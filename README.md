Admin Foundry is a domain-agnostic admin dashboard built with Angular, designed as a scalable and production-ready foundation for enterprise applications across multiple industries. The project leverages Analog as a fullstack meta-framework, combining strong architectural conventions with an optimized developer experience.

The UI layer integrates Angular Material and Tailwind CSS to deliver a modern, accessible, and highly customizable interface, while Apache ECharts powers modular and reusable data visualizations. Internationalization is supported out of the box using Angular’s official i18n tooling.

With a strong focus on code quality, testing, and maintainability, the project includes unit and end-to-end testing strategies and enforces strict development guidelines. It is designed to be easily extended and adapted to different business domains without compromising consistency or scalability.

## Technologies

### Core Framework & Platform

- [Angular](https://angular.dev/) – A robust and opinionated front-end framework for building scalable applications, with strong focus on architecture, type safety, and long-term maintainability.

- [Analog](https://analogjs.org/) – A fullstack meta-framework for Angular that provides a modern application foundation, improving project structure, routing, and component composition.

### UI & Styling

- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.dev/) – The official Angular UI component library based on Material Design, offering accessibility, visual consistency, and production-grade components.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid development of modern, responsive, and highly customizable user interfaces.

### Internationalization

- [Angular i18n](https://angular.dev/guide/i18n) – Angular’s official internationalization solution, enabling native multi-language support from the core of the application.

### Data Visualization

- [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) – An open-source data visualization library providing interactive, high-performance, and highly configurable charts for admin dashboards.

### Testing & Quality Assurance

- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) – A behavior-driven development framework for unit testing application logic and isolated components.

- [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) – A test runner that executes unit tests in real browsers and integrates seamlessly with the Angular ecosystem.

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) – A modern end-to-end testing framework that ensures reliability of complete user flows across multiple browsers.

- [Angular Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) – A testing approach focused on user behavior, promoting reliable tests with minimal coupling to implementation details.

### Code Quality & Tooling

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) – A static code analysis tool used to enforce coding standards, best practices, and prevent common issues.

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) – An opinionated code formatter that guarantees consistent code style across the entire project.

- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) – A Git hooks manager that enables automated quality checks before commits and pushes.

- [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) – Runs linting and formatting tasks only on staged files, optimizing the local development workflow.

- [Sheriff](https://sheriff.softarc.io/) – An architectural governance tool for Angular used to enforce dependency rules and preserve long-term architectural integrity.
